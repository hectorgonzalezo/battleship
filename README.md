# Battleship Game

by HÃ©ctor Gonzalez Orozco

Built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

A recreation of the classic Battleship game.

The player can place their ships by dragging and dropping them in the board, and then plays by selecting a square in the opponent's board.

This project is made as a way to practice TDD using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test the game board, player and ship objects.
